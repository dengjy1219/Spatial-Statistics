# Spatial-Temporal Heterogeneity Study of Information and Technology Services Industry Under Digital Economy Age

Based on the industrial and commercial enterprise registration data of mainland China in 2005, 2010 and 2015, this paper unfolds the characteristics of spatio-temporal differentiation from **macro, meso and micro** perspectives using **spatial statistical analysis** methods for the core technology industry - **information & science** and **technology service industry**, which is the core technology industry that promotes the release of new kinetic energy from data, in the context of China's digital economy development, spatial agglomeration pattern and structural characterization. Considering the spatial and temporal heterogeneity, the study also empirically investigates the factors influencing the industrial structure of information and science and technology service industry by applying the spatial and temporal geographically weighted regression model to measure the influence of the development of the digital economy on the industrial structure of the information and science and technology service industry as well as the effect of its spatial and temporal heterogeneity.

The results of the study show that: spatial characteristics, China's information and science and technology service industry has significant spatial **agglomeration** characteristics as a whole and in the eastern and central regions; the level of industrial digitization has a significant positive impact on the development of information and science and technology service industry, and digital industrialization promotes information and science and technology service industry to a lesser extent. In the more economically and technologically developed regions, the effect of the level of digital economization on the information and science and technology service industry has slightly declined; for the provinces that originally lagged behind in the digital economy in 2005, the effect of the level of industrial digitization and digital industrialization has been expanded.
